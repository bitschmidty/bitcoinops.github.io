        Sending RBF Transaction - Opendime does not have send transaction capabilities. You need to sweep the private key to use in a regular wallet.

        Sending RBF Transaction - There is a balance.py python script which can send a transaction using pycoin but does not specify RBF when creating a transaction.

        Receiving RBF Transaction - Opendime uses a simple address explorer on opendime.com. No RBF Flag. OPENDIMEâ€™s simple transaction list explorer does not provide RBF flag notice. However there are links to other explorers on the page (Blockchain.info, Blocktrail, LocalBitcoins, BitInfoCharts, a BIP122 link)

        Receiving Bumped RBF Transaction - Transaction list screen when a transaction has been bumped. Bottom transaction is the bumped fee transaction. Original transaction does not show up in list anymore.
