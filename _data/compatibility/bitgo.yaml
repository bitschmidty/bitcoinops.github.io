        BitGo's web wallet UI defaults to P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses.
        Visually, the segwit logo is displayed next to segwit addresses with a
        toolip indicating "Wrapped Segwit". While bech32 receive addresses are 
        not possible in the UI currently, bech32 receive addresses can be generated using the API.

        BitGo's web wallet allows sending to bech32 addresses. Change addresses
        are not bech32 native, but P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses.
